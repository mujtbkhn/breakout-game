Rules of Breakout Game

* The ball will start to go in the direction of Blocks
* when it touches any block it will remove the block and its space and return in the opposite direction
* when the ball comes back to your direction you need to move your block in order to get the ball place in your block 
* if it touches the ground other than your block the game is over

Enjoy:)
